# terms_sign
 Sign and stamp your documents in one click

 ## Usage
 Just adjust the settings in the ini-file and run it

 ## Examples
 [source](/terms_sign/terms.pdf)
  =>
 [signed](/terms_sign/terms_signed.pdf)
 :
 ![terms_sign](/images/terms_sign.png)

 ## Remarks
 You can remove the stamp and leave only the signature: to do so, simply delete the [STAMP 1] entry in the ini-file. You can also add more seals and stamps (entries [SIGN 2] and [STAMP 2], respectively).
